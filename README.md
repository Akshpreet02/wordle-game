# Wordle Game
This is a simple implementation of the popular Wordle game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random four-letter word, and the player has six attempts to guess the word by entering other four-letter words. The game will display a letter in green if it appears in the correct position in the secret word, in yellow if it appears in a different position, and in gray if it does not appear at all.

The project uses modern web development techniques, such as semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and modular JavaScript.

To play the game, simply download the project and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also customize the game by modifying the wordle.js file, which contains the API for list of possible secret words and hints and other settings.

Feel free to contribute to the project by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the design. Pull requests are always welcome!
